# Data Analytics Projects
In this repository I'm adding my compact data analytics projects. Each project focusses on a certain part of the data analysis process. My main objective is to practise my data analytics skills. I will be adding more projects over time.

## Key Features
- I work in a Juptyer Notebook for each project where I want to take the viewer along to show how I work with data.
- Each Jupyter Notebook has a short intro about the specific objective and a short summary of the dataset used.
- The Notebooks end with a short summary and conclusion on the project.

### Projects Overview
- [Finding the optimal model for prediction](https://github.com/Kessiia/data_analytics_projects/blob/85b2cc000643a17d75dcbc1d031ae3f35aeb0897/Practice%20Project%20-%20Data%20Analytics%20for%20Insurance%20Cost%20Dataset.ipynb): loading & cleaning data, running EDA, developing various LRM and using Ridge regression to refine the performance of the models.
